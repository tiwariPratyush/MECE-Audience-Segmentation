#  Strategic Analysis: MECE Segmentation Design Decisions

## Executive Summary

This document explains the strategic rationale behind the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) segmentation system for cart abandoner retention campaigns. The approach prioritizes **business actionability** over purely statistical optimization, ensuring each segment represents a distinct marketing strategy.

---

##  Why These Partitions Were Chosen

### 1. Hierarchical Business Logic
The segmentation follows a **value-first hierarchy**:

```
Primary Split: Average Order Value (AOV)
└── Secondary Split: Engagement Score  
    └── Tertiary Split: Profitability Score
        └── Catch-all: Recent Customer Behavior
            └── Final: Other Bucket (ELSE)
```

**Rationale**: AOV directly impacts campaign ROI. A $50 discount on a $2000 cart abandoner has different economics than the same offer to a $100 abandoner.

### 2. Percentile-Based Thresholds

| Feature | High Threshold | Medium Threshold | Justification |
|---------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| AOV | 75th percentile | 40th percentile | Captures high-value vs. typical customers |
| Engagement | 70th percentile | 40th percentile | Distinguishes engaged vs. passive users |
| Profitability | 70th percentile | N/A | Focuses on profitable customer segments |

**Why Percentiles Over Fixed Values**:
- **Data-Adaptive**: Thresholds adjust to actual distribution
- **Business-Relevant**: Always identifies the "top performers"
- **Scalable**: Works across different product categories and seasons

### 3. Strategic Segment Definitions

#### Segment 1: High AOV Premium
- **Logic**: AOV ≥ 75th percentile
- **Business Case**: These are your VIP customers. Even small conversion lifts generate significant revenue.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Premium recovery experiences, personal account manager outreach, exclusive offers.

#### Segment 2: Medium AOV + High Engagement  
- **Logic**: 40th ≤ AOV < 75th percentile & Engagement ≥ 70th percentile
- **Business Case**: Engaged mid-tier customers represent the "sweet spot" - reasonable cart values with high responsiveness.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Targeted discounts, urgency messaging, social proof.

#### Segment 3: Medium AOV + Medium Engagement + High Profitability
- **Logic**: 40th ≤ AOV < 75th percentile & 40th ≤ Engagement < 70th percentile & Profitability ≥ 70th percentile
- **Business Case**: Less engaged but highly profitable customers - worth targeted effort.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Value-focused messaging, loyalty program enrollment, educational content.

#### Segment 4: Low AOV + High Engagement
- **Logic**: AOV < 40th percentile & Engagement ≥ 70th percentile  
- **Business Case**: Price-sensitive but engaged users - potential for volume growth.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Smaller percentage discounts, bundle offers, referral programs.

#### Segment 5: Recent Customers
- **Logic**: Last order within 30 days & not captured in above segments
- **Business Case**: Already committed customers who may just need gentle nudging.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Soft reminders, complementary product suggestions, loyalty points.

#### Segment 6: Other Bucket (ELSE)
- **Logic**: All remaining users
- **Business Case**: Broad base requiring basic retention efforts - focus on efficiency over personalization.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Automated email sequences, general discounts, brand awareness.

##  How MECE Was Enforced

### 1. Mutual Exclusivity Implementation

```python
# Sequential mask application ensures no overlaps
s1_mask = df['avg_order_value'] >= aov_high
remaining_mask = ~s1_mask  # Exclude already assigned users

s2_mask = remaining_mask & (conditions)  # Only consider unassigned users
remaining_mask = remaining_mask & ~s2_mask  # Update remaining pool
```

**Key Principle**: Each subsequent segment only considers users not yet assigned, mathematically guaranteeing zero overlaps.

### 2. Collective Exhaustiveness Guarantee

```python
# Final ELSE bucket captures ALL remaining users
else_mask = remaining_mask  # Everything not yet assigned
```

**Validation Framework**:
-  Count check: `sum(all_segment_sizes) == total_universe_size`
-  Overlap check: `intersection(segment_A, segment_B) == empty_set`
-  Coverage check: `union(all_segments) == universe`

### 3. Business Rule Enforcement

**Minimum Segment Size (500 users)**:
- Ensures statistical significance for A/B testing
- Provides sufficient volume for campaign optimization
- Prevents over-segmentation that fragments audiences

**Maximum Segment Size (20,000 users)**:
- Maintains manageable campaign execution
- Allows for meaningful personalization
- Prevents "Other Bucket" from becoming too generic

**Auto-merge Logic**:
```python
if len(segment) < min_size:
    merge_into_parent_bucket(segment)
```

##  Scoring Methodology Deep Dive

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Approach
Rather than optimizing for a single metric, the system balances five business-critical dimensions:

#### Conversion Potential (25% weight)
- **Formula**: `(engagement_score × 0.7) + (recency_factor × 0.3)`
- **Logic**: Engagement predicts likelihood to respond; recency indicates current intent
- **Business Impact**: Directly correlates with campaign success rates

#### Profitability (25% weight)  
- **Formula**: `(profitability_score × 0.8) + (normalized_aov × 0.2)`
- **Logic**: Combines user profitability with transaction size potential
- **Business Impact**: Ensures focus on revenue-generating segments

#### Lift vs Control (20% weight)
- **Formula**: Simulated based on historical AOV and engagement patterns
- **Logic**: Higher-value, more engaged users typically show greater campaign lift
- **Business Impact**: Estimates incremental revenue from targeting

#### Strategic Fit (20% weight)
- **Formula**: Business-defined priority scores by segment type
- **Logic**: Reflects company priorities (e.g., focus on premium customers)
- **Business Impact**: Aligns segmentation with business strategy

#### Size Score (10% weight)
- **Formula**: Optimal size penalty function (peaks around 5,000 users)
- **Logic**: Very large segments become unwieldy; very small segments lack statistical power
- **Business Impact**: Ensures operational feasibility

### 2. Weight Rationale

The 25/25/20/20/10 weighting reflects:
- **Equal emphasis** on conversion and profitability (core business metrics)
- **Moderate weight** for lift estimation and strategic alignment (informed estimates)
- **Light weight** for size optimization (operational constraint)

### 3. Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action Priority |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.70 - 1.00 | Tier 1 - Premium | Immediate, high-touch campaigns |
| 0.60 - 0.69 | Tier 2 - Priority | Targeted campaigns with personalization |
| 0.50 - 0.59 | Tier 3 - Standard | Automated campaigns with basic targeting |
| < 0.50      | Tier 4 - Baseline | Generic retention efforts |
